# PiXRPG

PiX RPG was my entry for mini Ludum Dare \#63. This respository is for the continued development of the game. Updates are whenever I feel like chipping away at it. 

Currently very close to releasing a more demo build. But in the mean time, you can play the original LD build at either of the below links. Or, you can check out the Dev Gifs folder for a look at a visual history of the game's development. But do note that the framerates, resolution, etc. might not be fully representative of real gameplay due to the gif capturing software that I used.
